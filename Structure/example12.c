/*Mr. Tunam is having a very bad semester due to the course named SPL. He is very worried about
this course because he didn’t obtain good marks in the class tests (CTs). Help him to know the
marks of his class tests that will be counted in the final grading so that he can prepare adequately
for the final exam. Now, write a C program based on the following requirements:
i) Write a function input_CT_marks(float ct_marks[ ], int n), where ct_marks array stores the
marks he has already obtained in all the class tests, n is the number of class tests he has
attended, that takes the class test marks from user.
ii) Write a function take_Highest_CT(float ct_marks[ ], int n), which will find and return the
highest of the all CT marks.
iii) In the main() function, (1) declare and initialize the variables and arrays as needed, (2) call
the input_CT_marks and the take_Highest_CT functions, and (3) display the returned
value.*/
